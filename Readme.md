## iceFUNprog2

This project can program an iceFUNprog board amnd exists because I could not find anything
that would allow me to flash the board under MacOS or from the Windows command line.

Currently, the tool is able of:
* communicating with the board,
* resetting it,
* releasing it,
* getting the version of the board.
